# MyNotes

MyNotes is a student project for Griffith College Cork

## What is it?

MyNotes is a note-taking application made for Android. I didnâ€™t want to build a too basic application, but I wanted to make it complete and easy of use. Also, I think that design is one of the most important aspects of a mobile application. I needed to think about a good user experience, to make this application as good as possible. To do so, I analyzed many mobile applications, and tried to learn about what makes a good application. So, I tried to build a good user experience with a good design, with useful features and good performances.

## How was it build?

The application was built using Android Studio 3.0.
It was built using Jelly Bean 4.3 as minimum version.
Tests were performed using a physical Samsung Galaxy Note 8 under API 26, an emulated Nexus 5X under API 27 and an emulated Pixel 2 XL under API 16 (Jelly Bean).
The application works using a SQLite database, which allows it to save note and load them whenever the user needs it. 

## Main features

As any note-taking application, MyNotes basically allows the user to:
* Create a new note
* Edit an existing note
* Delete a note
* Edit settings
The application also provides many more features to increase the user experience:
* Text-format
* Note preview on the main activity
* Long press to delete or edit a note
* Animation when deleting a note
* Save or discard changes after editing a note
* Lines behind text when editing a note
* Notes sorting
* Search notes
* Fake notes generation
